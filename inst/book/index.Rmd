This site contains the workflow chapters of the `r BiocStyle::Biocbook("OSCA", label='__"Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor"__ book')`.
It contains worked case studies of analyses of a variety of single-cell datasets, each proceeding from a `SingleCellExperiment` object.
Exposition is generally minimal other than for dataset-specific justifications for parameter tweaks;
refer to the rest of the book for a detailed explanation of the theoretical basis of each step.
