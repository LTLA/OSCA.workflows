Description: 
    Deploys the workflows of the "Orchestrating Single Cell Analysis with Bioconductor" book.
    This contains worked case studies of analyses of a variety of single-cell datasets, each proceeding from a SingleCellExperiment object.
    Exposition is generally minimal other than for dataset-specific justifications for parameter tweaks;
    refer to the rest of the book for a detailed explanation of the theoretical basis of each step.
